# Client Changelog

Here will be the record of changes for the client plugin.

## Version 1.0.0

Initial release of the client plugin.

The client plugin has only two parts, an RPC registration which lets it talk to the server plugin, and a patch to the
chat message method which sends a copy of the message to the server plugin.
